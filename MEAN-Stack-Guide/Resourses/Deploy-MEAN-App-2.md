Certainly! Below is a sample `Dockerfile` for an Express.js application. This file provides instructions to Docker for building an image of your Express.js application.

```Dockerfile
# Step 1: Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:14

# Step 2: Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Step 3: Copy the package.json and package-lock.json (if available)
COPY package*.json ./

# Step 4: Install your application's dependencies
RUN npm install

# Step 5: Copy the rest of your application's code
COPY . .

# Step 6: Your app binds to port 3000 so you'll use the EXPOSE instruction to have it mapped by the docker daemon
EXPOSE 3000

# Step 7: Define the command to run your app
CMD [ "node", "app.js" ]
```

### Explanation:

- **FROM node:14**: This line sets the base image for subsequent instructions. Here, it's using version 14 of the official Node.js Docker image.
- **WORKDIR /usr/src/app**: Sets the working directory for any `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY`, and `ADD` instructions that follow in the `Dockerfile`.
- **COPY package*.json ./**: Copies both `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (if present) into the working directory.
- **RUN npm install**: Installs the dependencies defined in `package.json`.
- **COPY . .**: Copies the rest of your application's code (except what's ignored by `.dockerignore`) into the container.
- **EXPOSE 3000**: Informs Docker that the container listens on port 3000 at runtime. Note that this does not actually publish the port.
- **CMD [ "node", "app.js" ]**: Specifies the command to run within the container. This starts your Express.js application.

### Additional Points:

- Ensure that your application listens on the correct port and that `app.js` (or whatever your main file is named) is correctly referenced in the CMD instruction.
- You may want to create a `.dockerignore` file in your application's root directory to tell Docker to ignore files and directories such as `node_modules`, `npm-debug.log`, etc. This can prevent your local modules and debug logs from being copied onto your Docker image, potentially overwriting modules installed within your image.
- Adjust the Node.js version in the `FROM` instruction according to the version your application requires. 

Once your `Dockerfile` is set up, you can build your Docker image by running `docker build -t your-tag-name .` in the same directory as your `Dockerfile`.
